# Competition Use

While the dashboard is most useful for testing/development, it is still legal for use in the pits at competition (in essence, it falls into the category of OnBot Java and Blocks). However, the **dashboard cannot be used during a match**. To do so is in violation of RS09 (2020-2021 Game Manual) and not in the spirit of gracious professionalism.

Given this, we recommend that teams disable the dashboard using the "Disable Dashboard" menu item on the RC during competition and only briefly re-enable it in the pits for debugging. When disabled, all dashboard threads are halted and no websocket connections are permitted (although the web server is still functional).
